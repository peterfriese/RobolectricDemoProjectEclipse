RobolectricDemoProjectEclipse
=============================

This repository contains the source code for my demo "Bring Back the Fun to Testing Android Apps with Robolectric and FEST" at the [Eclipse DemoCamp November 2013 in Hamburg](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2013/Hamburg). 

The slides for the demo can be [found on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/peterfriese/bring-back-the-fun-to-testing-android-apps-with-robolectric). There also is a [blog post](http://www.peterfriese.de/unit-testing-android-apps-with-robolectric-and-eclipse/) outlining the steps that lead to the result you'll find in this repository.

The repository contains three projects:

* _RobolectricDemoProjectEclipse_ - the project under test
* _RobolectricDemoProjectEclipseTests_ - the project containing the Roboloectric tests
* _PlainOldTestProjectTest_ - a project containing Android Instrumentation tests, so you can compare the Robolectric tests to traditional tests.
